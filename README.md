## Introduction
**OpenSTARLab** is an open-source research platform designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis across sports and other dynamic multi-agent systems. Initially applied in soccer, OpenSTARLab provides tools for event annotation, data standardization, and predictive modeling using deep learning and reinforcement learning frameworks.

## Our Vision
We believe in making cutting-edge analytics accessible to everyone, from researchers to analysts, by providing open-source tools that overcome traditional data limitations in sports analytics. Our platform enables data collection from video, structured data, and simulated environments, advancing both academic research and real-world applications.

## Core Principles
- **Accessibility**: Open tools for data preparation, model training, and analysis.
- **Transparency**: Reproducible research through well-documented tools.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Bridging computer science, sports analytics, and data science.
- **Scalability**: Designed for both academic studies and real-world applications in various domains.

## Why OpenSTARLab?

### Challenges We Address
